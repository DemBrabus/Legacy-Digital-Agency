- This is a remake of an existing website https://fleava.com/ 
- I was really inspired by the original website and found a lot of enjoyment attempting to replicate 
    with React and my own development style.

### My Intention With This Project
    I chose to build a website for a digital agency because in general, digital agency websites have a 
    certain level of freedom with their design and development methodologies that enable them to truly 
    create a website that represents who they are and what they are capable of as a company and team. 
    I think that level of self expression and freedom to try new things is why I am attracted to this 
    style of website. I also really enjoy creating unique websites that challenge my skills in 
    development and design.

    My past projects have all been crucial stepping stones that have lead me to this project that 
    will combine everything I have learnt thus far in my career.

    With this project I hope to gain a deeper understand of:
        -React, Webpack, SASS, Application Architecture, 
        Organization, Project Management, Time Management, Development Efficiency, 
        Development Quality, Design,
