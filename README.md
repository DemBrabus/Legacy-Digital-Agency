Custom React Website For Legacy | A Premium Digital Agency
====================================================

## Built Using My Own React Template

### My Intention With This Project
    I chose to build a website for a digital agency because in general, digital agency websites have a certain level of freedom with their design and development methodologies that enable them to truly create a website that represents who they are and what they are capable of as a company and team. I think that level of self expression and freedom to try new things is why I am attracted to this style of website. I also really enjoy creating unique websites that challenge my skills in development and design.

    My past projects have all been crucial stepping stones that have lead me to this project that will combine everything I have learnt thus far in my career.

        -React, Webpack, SASS, GSAP, Page Transitions, Animations, Application Architecture, Organization, Project Management, Time Management, Development Efficiency, Development Quality, Design,
